### Thoughts so far:
- Getting started with the project
- Plan to create the index file and handle the B-tree node insertions

### Plan for the session:
- Implement the file creation and header writing logic
- Implement simple insert functionality

### Progress:
- Successfully created the index file with a basic header structure.
- Insert functionality partially implemented.
- Having issues with printing the index - stopped working for the day here (will pick up on this next time I work)

### Thoughts so far:
- Going good so far - making good progress
- I would say I'm in a good place as I am not procrastinating

### Plan for the session:
- Debug the printing index section and figure out why I keep getting a warning

### Progress:
- No longer getting a warning with Printing Index - still some minor errors
