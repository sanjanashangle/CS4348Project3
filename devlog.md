## November 29 4:30PM

### Thoughts so far:
- Getting started with the project
- Plan is to create the index file and handle the B-tree node insertions

### Plan for the session:
- Implement the file creation and header writing logic
- Implement simple insert functionality

### Progress:
- Working right now - will update with new entry below

----------------------------

## November 29 6:30PM (Done for the session)

### Progress:
- Successfully created the index file with a basic header structure.
- Insert functionality partially implemented.
- Having issues with printing the index - stopped working for the day here (will pick up on this next time I work)
- Overall, I accomplished my goal for the session and was able to accomplish a little bit more as I got started with the printing command.

----------------------------

## December 2 12:08PM

### Thoughts so far:
- Going good so far - making good progress
- I would say I'm in a good place as I am not procrastinating
- Not really any new thoughts other than I will have to debug my printing command (this might take a while)

### Plan for the session:
- Debug the printing index section and figure out why I keep getting a warning

### Progress:
- Working right now - will update with new entry below

----------------------------

## December 2 1:30PM (Done for the session)

### Progress:
- No longer getting a warning with Printing Index - still some minor errors
- Almost achieved my goal for the session, just a little bit more work to do with the printing command.

----------------------------

## December 2 2:30PM

### Thoughts so far:
- Going good so far - making good progress
- Definitely in a good place as I am not procrastinating
- New thoughts: printing command still has to be fully functional so I need to get it fully working this session!

### Plan for the session:
- Work on the 'Search Key' as I am getting some errors
- Finish working on the 'Print Index'

### Progress:
- Working right now - will update with new entry below

----------------------------

## December 2 5:00PM (Done for the session)

### Progress:
- Finished the 'Search Key' and 'Print Index'
- Goal accomplished for the session! Went a little above my goal as I made sure the Search command was fully functional too!

----------------------------FIX FROM ABOVE

## December 3 12:45AM

### Thoughts so far:
- Feeling really good - getting closer and closer to finishing the project
- Not really any new thoughts

### Plan for the session:
- The last things I have to implement are:
    - Fix the load command
    - Fix the extract command
(Plan is to implement these two commands)
- I will first tackle the load command and resolve all errors and will then do the same for the extract command

### Progress:
- Working right now - will update with new entry below

----------------------------

## December 3 1:30AM (Done for the session)

### Progress:
- Load command is fully functional now!
- Have a little bit work on the extract command left
- So, I was able to complete half my goal for this session (I am stopping for the night and will continue in the morning)
- Next session I will fix the extract command so it is fully working, I left off with some errors.

----------------------------

## December 3 3:27PM

### Thoughts so far:
- Almost there! I am having some trouble converting the binary file now actally...currently working to fix this.

### Plan for the session:
- Continue working on the extract command and resolving the errors I face when running this command
- If I can, I want to try doing a few full runs of the code after everything is implemented perfectly so I can see the functional code all in one run

### Progress:
- Working right now - will update with new entry below

----------------------------

## December 3 6:03PM (Done for the session)

### Progress:
- Extract command is fully functional now!
- I was able to do a few test runs and everything is looking good! I don't have any errors with any of the commands
- Next session I want to review everything one more time and then submit!

----------------------------

## December 8 9:59PM

### Thoughts so far:
- I am finished with the project!

### Plan for the session:
- Run a few tests and make sure everything is functional!
- Create the README file!

### Progress:
- Just running tests!

----------------------------

## December 3 11:03PM (Done for the session)

### Progress:
- I finished making the README file
